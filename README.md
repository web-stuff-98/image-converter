This is an image converter using electron-react-boilerplate and Sharp js. I just made it because I needed another example and a boilerplate electron app that works with Sharp js.

You have to install Sharp inside the release/app folder instead of the root folder or it wont build, which means installing it as a native dependency. Took a while to find that out.
